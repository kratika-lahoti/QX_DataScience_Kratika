The bankruptcy tribunal will consider putting Reliance Naval & Engineering Ltd. in bankruptcy on Wednesday.
Anil Ambani
Mumbai:
The shipyard controlled by embattled tycoon Anil Ambani is facing the prospect of bankruptcy after failing to get creditors approval for restructuring Rs 7,000 crore ($970 million) of debt, people familiar with the matter said.
The bankruptcy tribunal will consider putting Reliance Naval & Engineering Ltd. in bankruptcy on Wednesday as no new repayment plan was submitted after lenders led by IDBI Bank rejected an earlier offer in July, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. The court can also defer the decision on bankruptcy.

Any court ruling favouring the banks would deal another blow to the tycoons stressed empire after his wireless carrier slipped into insolvency earlier this year. The revival of the shipyard is crucial for the tycoon.

$500K needed to investigate and fix Britannia berm after spring flood exposes leaks,"Print
The city wants to spend $500,000 to bolster the Britannia Village berm after the spring flood exposed leaks in the barrier.
According to a staff report for city council, the Rideau Valley Conservation authority will coordinate the work, which includes an investigation into the leaks and the repairs.
The earth berm was fully constructed by the end of 2017 at a cost of $2 million. Britannia property owners who directly benefit from the protective berm are helping to pay for the barrier through a 10-year special levy, which will contribute $195,000.
While leaks have appeared in the berm, the city and conservation authority credit the barrier for protecting homes during the 2017 and 2019 floods along the Ottawa River.
To pay for the $500,000 in work, the city intends to use the money from accounts earmarked for joint projects with conservation authorities and stormwater improvements.",Black Swan Events - Alert me when a company faces an exceptional loss,Negative News,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four workers are feared dead and nine have been injured in a landslide at a Coal India Ltd mine in the eastern state of Odisha, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.

BENGALURU/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian software services exporter Wipro Ltd reported a 13% rise in first-quarter profit thanks to robust demand from financial clients and said its main information technology business could show modest growth in the current quarter.

The stock of Asian Paints, the leading paint-maker in the country, declined about 2 per cent on the back of disappointing March quarter results. The companys net profit declined 2 per cent y-o-y to 487 crore due to lower realisations and higher input costs. Sales grew 12 per cent y-o-y to 5,018 crore.
Though the company reported double-digit volume growth in its decorative segment, the contribution of low-end products such as putty and distempers was higher, and it depressed overall realisations. In the industrial paints segment, automotive coatings witnessed good growth. However, the auto OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) segment saw a subdued growth on the back of the slowdown in the underlying sector.
High input costs and the volatility in the rupee made the operating margin contract by 2 percentage points to 16 per cent, y-o-y.

Singtel said its net profit for the first quarter fell 35% on year mainly because of losses suffered by its Indian associate Bharti Airtel Ltd. (532454.BY).
Net profit for the quarter ended June was 541 million Singapore dollars (US$392 million), Singtel said in a statement Thursday.
The company also attributed the fall in net profit to higher depreciation and amortisation costs in network and spectrum across the group.
Operating revenue rose 2% on year in the first quarter to S$4.11 billion.

. Only 12% (one-third of that total) is tariff-affected, per the Q1 call - but at a 25% rate, that's still a potentially material headwind to a company with EBITDA margins of barely 10% and operating margins in the 6% range.
And as impressive as the top line in Q4 and Q1 was, it's not like The Container Store necessarily is expecting a banner year. Full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $0.41-0.51 was reiterated after Q1. That range suggests growth from FY18's $0.42. But at the midpoint, interest expense savings account for all of the growth, and then some. By my calculations, guidance (again, at the midpoint) suggests Adjusted EBITDA will actually decline 3-4% year over year - and come in 5-6% above levels seen five years ago. Over that stretch, the store count will have risen by over one-third.
So, there's logic behind some level of skepticism toward Q4 and Q1 comps. Q1 sales, to at least some extent, were achieved through discounting.

Yes Bank will soon reach out to shareholders for fresh approval for another capital-raising; however, this time it is looking to bring in strategic investors since the dilution of shareholding this time will be much higher, said one of the two people cited above, asking not to be named.

Indian shares edge lower over global recession fears,"* NSE index falls 0.09%, BSE index 0.1% lower
* GAIL India, Wipro among top gainers
By Chandini Monnappa
May 29 (Reuters) - Indian shares inched lower on Wednesday, dragged down by State Bank of India and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, amid lingering concerns about a global economic slowdown.
The broader NSE index was down 0.026% at 11,896.40 as of 0450 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was trading 0.26% lower at 39,646.18.
The rupee fell as much as 0.22% to 69.840 against the dollar, as oil prices slipped and broader Asian shares struggled to find ground over concerns that the ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions could result in a global economic downturn.
Global markets were facing turbulence and domestic investors are shifting focus to these global cues and other macro factors impacting markets, said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Securities.

Despite the new tariff order, ZEE has managed to post a 16% YOY growth in advertising revenues to Rs 1,217.5 crore, while subscription revenues also grew at a modest 3.4% to Rs 565.3 crore during the quarter.
Total expenditure for the quarter stood at Rs 1,451 crore, registering a 19% increase, mainly because of a 28.1% increase in the programming cost (883.3 crore) and 23% increase in employee cost (Rs 201.5 crore).
Programming cost was driven primarily by the content cost for ZEEs video streaming service ZEE5, launch expense of channel in Kerala and movie production and distribution business cost.

Mahindra stated that the communication wasn't lost and that every single person in India could feel the heartbeat of Chandrayaan-2. The entire nation could hear it say that If at first you dont succeed, try, try again.
Mahindra has been very supportive of ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 mission to land on moon since the start. Earlier, he has given full marks to ISRO not just for their technological prowess but also for their communication skills. ""Theyre master storytellers, making us all partners in their narrative.

And bolero passes because its manual transmission. Manual is always powerful than automatic. Its proved, commented a third. Be cool DUDE! Its A Bolero Camper, wrote a forth YouTube user.
There were also some who tagged industrialist Anand Mahindra to bring the video to his attention. And, it worked.

Reliance Industries Ltds telecom unit Jio pipped rival Bharti Airtel to become Indias second-largest operator by subscribers as of May, government data showed.
Jio, controlled by Asias richest man Mukesh Ambani, has disrupted the telecom industry in the country since it was launched in 2016, offering cheap bundles and prompting shutdowns.
As of the end of May, the operator had added 8.2 million users since April to end the month with 323 million wireless customers, data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, showed. The data was published on Friday.
Both Vodafone Idea, which was the top operator with 387.6 million customers, and Bharti Airtel lost users over the month.

If Andy McCluskeys revelation that he bought OMDs first synthesizer (a Korg Micro Preset) from his mums mail-order catalogue doesnt fire your electrodes, this may not be the popdoc for you. For everyone else this 2009 jaunt down Mellotron Lane is a thing of beauty.
Theres a warped romance to bootstrap tales of scrimping for synths. Or to the tippy-tap intro of Messages or Wendy Carloss stately Purcell tribute played over footage of grey skies and demolition sites. Phil Oakey, Bernard Sumner and Daniel Miller are among the 70s techno kids who were inspired by Kraftwerk and JG Ballard, and who likened the studio to a sweet shop.

Il dolce far niente is an Italian phrase which describes the sweet essence and enjoyment of doing nothing.
Although it is effectively untranslatable into English, we came to fully understand the concept during a short break on Lake Como.

The four of us were at Europes largest floating lido, just across the road from Hotel Britannia Excelsior in Cadenabbia on the western shore of Como.

1893 Royal Yacht Britannia Scaled Sailboat Model,"More info
Dimension: 30"" L X 37"" H
His Majestys Yacht Britannia was a gaff-rigged cutter built in 1893 for Commodore Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. It served him and his son, King George V, a long racing career.
 After the Prince of Wales nephew Kaiser Wilhelm II acquired the racing cutter Thistle in 1891, her Scottish designer George Lennox Watson received a commission from Edward VII for a sailing yacht in 1892. He designed His Royal Highness Yacht Britannia to the Length And Sail Area Rule as a First Class cutter and had her built alongside his Americas Cup challenger Valkyrie II at the D & W Henderson Yard on the River Clyde. She was launched on April 20th, 1893, a week ahead of Valkyrie II.
 By the end of her first years racing, the Britannia had scored thirty-three wins from forty-three starts. In her second season, she won all seven races for the big class yachts on the French Riviera, and then beat the 1893 Americas Cup defender Vigilant in home waters.

The Eroica Britannia event is taking place in Derbyshire this weekend - with a major change to previous years.
The festival, which is now in its sixth year, usually takes place over a weekend, but this year a one-off event of 500 riders is taking place on Sunday instead.
The changes are due to the 200th anniversary celebrations for Bakewell Show, which means the full weekend event can't take place at Bakewell Showground.
Here's everything you need to know.
What is Eroica Britannia?
The event celebrates vintage cycling, as well as Great British life and style.
What is happening with this year's event?
This year, instead of events and rides across the weekend, there will be one ride only. Open to just 500 riders, instead of the usual 4,500, Sunday's ride has already sold out.
The ride will take in some of the most beautiful landscape in the Peak District, and will also be recorded in order to create a film about the event.

Amid onslaught of dengue, the private pathology labs are cashing on the scare of the disease in provisional state capital. From the alarmed patients and their relatives, the pathology labs are charging anything between Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 for a test of dengue. In these labs the test of dengue is done on the basis of antigen presence in the blood sample of the patient and is called rapid test. The authenticity of this test is however not very reliable. A kit of rapid test costs around Rs 250 and the test report usually comes in 15 minutes. Due to the unreliable nature of the rapid test, the state health department accepts the report of Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test for dengue confirmation.

The use of many of these labs was not approved in advance by the HSE or CervicalCheck, as required under contracts, nor was it known to them.
One lab, in Greater Manchester, was not approved was retrospectively accredited for work done when its existence was unknown to the Irish accreditation authorities.
However, Dr Scally said he has not identified any evidence that the past or present lab services used by CervicalCheck were providing a service which does not meet acceptably standards in their country of operation.
The two major accreditation standards applicable in different countries appear to be comparable and do not create any cause for concern in terms of the quality of laboratory services provided.

The Water Balance- Business News,"June 2, 2019
Budhera, a rocky and water-deficit village 60 kilometres from Hyderabad, on the Mumbai highway, would seem an unlikely area to showcase sustainable growth for the NYSE-listed pharmaceuticals major, Dr Reddy's. Much has changed since the company shelved plans to set up an SEZ unit there three years ago. The 350-plus acre plot now plays a crucial role in Dr Reddy's emerging as a 100 per cent water neutral company.
Water neutrality is all about balancing the demand and supply of water through a deliberate intervention by the water user.
""We have a solar park on the periphery and account for all the water harvested by us. Our aim is to become 100 per cent water neutral in four to five years,"" says G.V. Prasad, Co-chairman and CEO of the company, who takes personal interest in what happens at Budhera and other sustainability efforts of the company. ""I set the goals on sustainability efforts.

I cannot predict the price movement although intuitively I think the stock price should move up and at the end of the day, it is a good beginning and what I am most pleased about is the fact that there will be no change in management because the Zee management has been exceptionally good.

Gail Dixon has been in Christian ministry and missionary work for nearly 40 years, first with World Horizons and more lately leading its sister organisation, Nations Trust. This inspiring devotional book emerges from her wide-ranging experiences and is based on personal reflection over a long life of discipleship.
One imagines her sitting before the Lord, after all these years of walking with him and praying to him, and being inspired to share the most central aspects of her relationship with him. What has resulted is a book is about the covenant love of Jesus within the battle for the salvation of many - hence the title,

COUNTERPOINT: Mass shooting stats overblown,"3 hours ago
Sorry you must be at least 19 years of age to consume this content.
I would like to correct an error made by Gail Lethbridge in her Aug. 10 column regarding mass shootings in the U.S. She cites the number calculated by the private group Gun Violence Archive for 2019 as 253. She then says that they categorize a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are killed.
This is a significant factual error. The GVA, in fact, has a much broader definition of the term mass shooting, and it includes, among other incidents, non-fatal ones involving a firearm. This is why their total of 253 is such an outlier compared to others.
If one adheres to the four or more people killed criterion that she mentions, as used by the USDOJ/FBI/AP, then, in that case, the Dayton shooting was the 22nd so far in 2019.

Hero MotoCorp is the country's biggest two-wheeler maker. In fact, it is said that it is also the world's biggest as well. While the company has been profitable most of the times, there were instances wherein its products didn't click. These included both 125cc (Super Splendor) as well as even 100cc offerings like the HF Eco. However, today we are going to concentrate on the 150cc machines that Hero built right from the first CBZ to the recent Achiever. While the CBZ despite its high price (for that time) was a runaway hit, the others weren't so lucky. Here is a look at these five machines that Hero discontinued due to poor sales.

However, in the last two-two and a half years, the premium between coconut oil and palm kernel oil has been shrinking and right now the crop which has come last year, the coconut prices have dipped further down.

I am deeply concerned about any landfill development near the Great Salt Lake shoreline, especially Promontory Point Resources landfill on Promontory Peninsula. By issuing PPR (an out-of-state company) permits without requiring groundwater modeling, the state is demonstrating that greed and short-term economic development trump long-term economic stability and public health.
Environmental concern about Great Salt Lakes hemispheric importance to millions of birds should be enough to stop this landfill. Sadly, it is not. Which is why we need to highlight Great Salt Lakes contributions to our economy and the public health of all who live along the Wasatch Front.

Mahindra & Mahindra ends 25-year association with Mumbai Hockey Association Limited: Report,"Mumbai Mirror

The company has declined MHALs request of funds for the maintenance of the Mahindra Stadium in Churchgate. This decision has left the hockey association shocked and baffled.
Mahindra & Mahindra has written a letter to MHAL, wishing the association all the best for their future endeavours apart from stating the fact that it cannot allocate additional funds.
The MHAL would make money by renting the space behind the stands for private functions but theyve been struggling to meet the high cost of maintaining the stadium.
Maintenance of a stadium is a big ask. the report quoted MHAL president Mangha Singh Bakshi as saying.
Right from the pitch to the stands to the players dormitory, everything needs to be maintained whether there are matches held or not. There are other expenses like the staff which the MHAL has to manage from its own pocket. We are hoping some corporate will come to our rescue.

AMTs. Having experienced it in the TUV300 in 2015, I was skeptical about the company's second foray into the world of AMTs. This too with its most advanced sub-4m SUV, the XUV300. However, when I started driving, I quickly realised things have changed. This you will have easily guessed from the headline, isn't it? Now, let's get on with what caused the shift.
Take a deep look at the XUV300 AMT and you will not find anything different than the manual. Save for the Autoshift badge at the rear. As is the norm these days, the XUV300 doesn't even carry any engine badging anywhere. The interior too looks the same as the manual version. This means a high-quality cabin but with an automatic stick instead of the manual one. Look closely to the right side of the steering wheel and you will notice the start-stop button missing. This button in the manual shuts off the engine when the gear lever is slotted in neutral and restarts it when",Irrelevant News,Uncategorised News,,,,,,,,,,,,

It plans to do so by leveraging its upcoming maze of data centres across the country that will run Microsofts Azure platform.
Just as RILs entry into the cellular space led to mobile data explosion, its entry into the enterprise market, particularly its offerings to SMEs, will disrupt pricing and increase affordability of enterprise solutions and drive substantial adoption of data growth among small businesses who are currently not using enterprise services, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said in a note seen by ET.

How Reliance Jio Became Indias Wireless Wonder,"Photographed by Vivek Singh for Fortune
Theres a new king
of telecom in India: Reliance Jio Infocomm, the wireless carrier created by multibillionaire Mukesh Ambani, which ranked No. 1 on
last years Change the World list
. The network had 331 million subscribers at the end of June, exceeding Vodafone Idea (320 million customers) for the first time. Owned by Ambanis energy and retailing giant, Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL), the telecom company could become the foundation of an online and e-commerce platform in India that rivals Alibaba in China and
Amazon
in the U.S., analysts at UBS predict.

No officer has been arrested or charged in connection with the shootings, and a judicial commission set up to investigate has provided no updates on its progress.
The incident was one of the deadliest environmental protests in India in a decade.

Wipro opens digital products compliance lab in Hyderabad
Outsourcing company Wipro has opened a digital product compliance lab in Hyderabad for automotive, defense, consumer electronics, aerospace, telecom, medical, energy and manufacturing.
Wipro said it is now home to the only lab in South East Asia qualified to certify Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices.
Globally, devices have to comply with a variety of emission and safety standards, or the products get caught in import bans.
Because of the varying standards and expectations in each country, it becomes difficult for global manufacturers to ensure compliance in each jurisdiction. Facilities like Wipros Tarang Labs help ease the process by providing a one-stop-shop to test for compliance across the world.
Wipro also offers product design and interoperability testing services, which can also come in handy in case any product turns out to be non-compliant with any particular standard and needs to be fine tuned to comply.

In contrast to most lakes here on Earth, many of the lakes found on Titans surface are surrounded by steep ridges stretching hundreds of feet into the sky. Exactly how those structures formed is a question scientists are eager to answer, a new model suggests a possible explanation.
Using radar data from Cassini, scientists have built computer simulations that show how explosions of warming nitrogen within Titans crust could have formed such basins. Its possible, the researchers say, that liquid nitrogen, enduring periods of cooling and heating thanks to the greenhouse effect from Titans atmosphere, could have heated rapidly enough that, when it vaporized, it caused an explosion in the crust and formed craters.

Titan Taylor fit for Queensland Cup finals,"e-mail
His NRL teammates may be wrapping up their dismal campaign on Saturday, but Gold Coast half Ash Taylor is gearing up for finals.
The million-dollar playmaker will line-up for the Tweed Heads Seagulls in the first week of the Queensland Cup finals after recovering from an ankle injury.
Since taking a brief break from the game in June for personal reasons, Taylor has played just once for the Titans - a 58-6 mauling at the SCG by Sydney Roosters in round 20.
In that time the 24-year-old has however made five appearances for the Titans' feeder club Tweed and looms as a key figure in Sunday's final against Redcliffe at Piggabeen Sports Complex.
Titans caretaker coach Craig Hodges confirmed Taylor would be ""100 per cent fit"" to return from the injury which sidelined him from Tweed's 12-10 win over Northern Pride last weekend.
By the time Taylor takes to the field, the Titans' miserable NRL season will be over with a home game against fellow strugglers St George Illawarra a last chance",Irrelevant News,Uncategorised News,,,,,,,,,,,,

Control Tested at 8K: NVIDIA TITAN RTX Uses 18GB of VRAM,"Control is the new Crysis
There, I've said it. Article over.
It really should be that easy, because it seriously is the new Crysis. Remedy Entertainment must have sold their soul to the devil, or at least have disappeared into the Hiss, with Control. It is an absolute beauty to play through, especially with RTX turned up all the way.
Crysis blew our minds back in 2006 and quickly became a running joke of building a new gaming PC with the whole ""can it run Crysis"" thing, it has lasted for 13 years now, and I think it is time to retire it. The new thing should be ""can it run Control"" and secondly, ""can it run Control with RTX turned on"".
But that's never enough for me, it never has been. I'm a speed freak when it comes to PCs and always love pushing the boundaries of what is possible when gaming, always wanting to hit the highest refresh rate and resolution. I wasn't into cars or partying when I was young (and even now) my entire obsession is with technology and gaming.

The chance for Jai Arrow's partner to further her modelling career could work in favour of Sydney NRL clubs desperate to prise the top Titan away from the Gold Coast.
Arrow is prepared to test his market value from November 1 and ignore a four-year, $3 million deal on the table to remain with the struggling Titans as Wests Tigers, Cronulla and the Bulldogs prepare to open talks.

Arun Jaitley and I became friends well before we met each other in Delhi University in 1977.

The contents were brief and only requested me to raise the issue of permission to the interned DUSU president to take his MA Final Exams in Law, permission which required clearance from the Universitys Academic Council of which I was then a Student Member. Although I did not personally know Jaitley then and our college, namely, St Stephens, was not remotely involved in University politics, I thought it to be my democratic duty to help an unfairly interned opposition leader to be allowed to sit for his examination.

Whos the heart and soul of your team?
That is tough right now, as the Dolphins are going through a rebuild. Cameron Wake used to be an easy answer, but hes now a Titan and the Dolphins have a bunch of younger players looking to prove themselves. Over the next few years, players like Xavien Howard, Minkah Fitzpatrick, and Christian Wilkins will probably take on that role, and you could probably argue its already Howard. Instead, lets say head coach Brian Flores for now. He is clearly establishing the Dolphins as his team. It feels different around the franchise in 2019.

Titan FC featherweight champion Jason Soares spoke to FanSided about his last fight and how he uses it for motivation ahead of Titan FC 56.
Titan FC 54 was business as usual for current featherweight champion Jason The Specimen Soares. He was preparing to defend his championship for the second time against short-notice replacement Ariston Franca in front of a hometown crowd.
The scene was a familiar one for the champion, but there was one slight difference in this fight night. UFC President Dana White was in the audience filming his show,

Hoorn became one of six homes to the former Dutch East India Company and it has a 17th Century town centre whose main square is called Roode Steen. Quickly becoming one of the wealthiest and most important towns on the Zuiderzee, Hoorn's population has grown to more than 70,000 inhabitants today.
One of Hoorn's many claims to fame relates to a pair of Dutch ships which negotiated a safe passage around the southern most tip of South America on their way from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.

If you're unfamiliar with the series the premise is humanity has to live within huge walled cities to protect themselves from giant, naked humanoid creatures known as Titans that see people as a tasty snack. I find them deeply unsettling. From that basic concept, it sounds like the ideal setting for a tower defence game doesn't it?
Based on the trailer there will be traps you can deploy to slow down the Titans as well as Scouts to fight them, many of which you'll recognise from the anime like Levi and main character Eren Jaeger. There will be around 40 available on launch and each of them will have their own abilities so you can expect using them at opportune moments to be where the strategy comes in.

The factory in Tongala, which produces mainly milk products, will progressively halt operations over the next 18 months.
Nestle general manager for Beverages and Dairy in Oceania Andrew McIver said the decision for the closure was partly due to consumers buying less tinned milk than they used to, adding that cheaper imports had eroded the business.
""At the same time, the equipment in this factory is old and the investment we need to make sure it can operate reliably in the future means that the factory is no longer viable,"" Mr McIver said.
The manufacture of products currently being made at Tongala will be moved to Nestle factories overseas during the next 12 to 18 months, Mr McIver said.

The Tata Steel Ltd said on Monday it would shut parts of its non-core businesses in the United Kingdom, a move that could cost about 400 jobs.
The steelmaker proposed to close its loss-making Orb Electrical Steels site in South Wales, potentially affecting up to 380 jobs, as it was unable to find a way forward for the business, it said in a filing to Indian stock exchanges.

Orb is part of one of these businesses, Cogent, which makes electrical steels.
Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges, said Henrik Adam, chief executive officer of Tata Steels European operations.

No progress in petition filed in September last, firm delaying admission of plea
Private sector lender ICICI Bank on Monday approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), seeking a direction to NCLT Allahabad to hear urgently its insolvency petition against Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JAL) and pass orders without any further delay.
In its plea before the appellate tribunal, ICICI Bank submitted that there had been no progress in its insolvency petition against JAL filed in September last year.
Several forums moved
The bank alleged that the Jaypee Groups flagship firm was delaying admission of the insolvency plea by approaching several judicial forums. ICICI Bank also said that the hearing before the Allahabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was adjourned almost 12 times from September 10, 2018, to May 27, 2019, and such adjournments were unfairly delaying the resolution process.

Stocks likely to be in the limelight today?
HDFC and Bajaj twins, L&T, and ICICI Bank
Sectors likely to impact the market today?
Financials, consumer staples & discretionary, energy and realty.
Your mid-term view?
This is likely to be a short-term bottom for a rangebound play between 10900 and 11200. The lower range of 10800 suggests oversold zone for Nifty. Hence, a short-term bounce, which was overdue, is likely to be played out. Taking out 11180 would confirm the next move to 11390.

NEW DELHI, Sept 8: Reliance Industries is seeking a minimum price of USD 5.4 per unit for the natural gas it plans to produce from newer fields in the Bay of Bengal block KG-D6 as it changed parameters to suit government policies.
Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK have sought bids from potential users for the 5 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from second quarter of 2020, according to the bid document.
Bidders have been asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
It set a floor or minimum quote of 9 per cent of dated Brent price  which means bidders would have to quote 9 or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.

Indian automakers Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) said on Friday they would cut production at some plants in response to slowing demand that industry executives say has driven the sector into one of its worst downturns.
Tata Motors, which had previously flagged a challenging external environment, said it closed some blocks at its Pune plant in Maharashtra.
The company, Indias top automaker by revenue, had last month posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss due to weak conditions at home and problems at its British luxury car unit.
M&M said on Friday its automotive segment, which makes passenger and commercial vehicles and spare parts, would cut production for 8-14 days at various plants during the second quarter.
Shares of Tata Motors and M&M fell between 1.8% and 2.4% before cutting losses in a broader Mumbai market that was 1.3% higher as of 0720 GMT.

Zambian court blocks asset sale by Konkola Copper Mines...,"e-mail
LUSAKA, June 27 (Reuters) - Vedanta Resources said on Thursday a Zambian court has issued an order halting any move by the provisional liquidator of its Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) business to dispose of KCM's assets or make arrangements with its creditors.
Zambian state mining company ZCCM-IH holds about 20% of KCM, while Vedanta Resources, part-owner of the Mumbai-listed Vedanta group of companies, holds a majority.
Zambia's dispute with Vedanta began in May when the government of Africa's second biggest copper producer appointed a liquidator to run KCM, saying it had breached its licence. Vedanta Resouces has denied this is the case.
China's Nonferrous Metals Mining Corporation (CNMC), commodities trader ETG Group and a Turkish firm have expressed interest in buying a stake in KCM, a senior government source said last month, on condition of anonymity.
The government source said CNMC had offered $2 billion for KCM, adding there had also been talks with ETG Group, a diversified ",Other negative news,Negative News,,,,,,,,,,,,

The report notes that while the threat actor groups use of open-source tooling allowed them to scale their operations while limiting analysts ability to easily attribute activity to a known actor group based on tool reuse, the analysis by RiskIQ highlights how organisations can build off of a small set of network-based

If these subsidies were not being provided, Adanis Carmichael thermal coal mine would be unbankable and unviable, the report said.

Will Historia Be A Good Queen?
The denizens of the walled city had to contend not only with Titans, but the absolute ruler of their monarchy. Sitting comfortably within the innermost wall, the king ruled a society built on lies; that is, no one knows that there is indeed a world outside the city's limits.
Historia Reiss, first known as Krista, is, in fact, royalty, and she assumes the throne after the protagonists overthrow the reigning monarch. This queen seems just and fair, and she understands the struggle of fighting Titans. But can she handle all the other administrative work of running a massive city? And can we be sure that she won't fall to madness or paranoia or worse? Being monarch puts you in the center of many powerful forces, after all.

ANI
Mumbai, Mar 26 : Grasim Industries has challenged the Rs 5,872.13 crore demand from Income Tax Department with respect to its merger with two Aditya Birla group firms.
The Bombay High Court, while granting time to the department for filing the reply, has granted a stay against the recovery of demand, the company said in regulatory filings to stock exchanges.
Grasim contended before the court that order was wholly unsustainable in law.
In September 2017, the National Company Law Tribunal bench at Ahmedabad had approved the merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo with Grasim Industries to be followed by the listing of Aditya Birla Financial Services.
On March 14 this year, the company received a communication issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, raising a demand of Rs 5,872.13 crore on account of dividend distribution tax (including interest).

US sues to block Hindalco subsidiarys Aleris buyout

Washington:
The US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Novelis, a major aluminium company fully owned by India's Aditya Birla Group, seeking to stop it from acquiring rival player Aleris over concern that the proposed USD 2.6 billion acquisition would create a monopoly in the aluminium industry.
A defiant Novelis asserted that it will challenge the lawsuit and is going ahead with its proposed acquisition of Aleris Corporation. Atlanta-headquarters Novelis is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hindalco Industries Ltd of the Aditya Birla Group. Aleris is based in Cleveland, Ohio.

Hindalco announces acquisition of Aleris Corp for $2.6 billion
The lawsuit is premised on the contention that the only relevant competition among automotive body sheet providers is that among aluminum manufacturers such as Novelis and Aleris.
It ignores competition from steel automotive body sheet, even though steel is currently used for nearly 90 per cent of the market, said Novelis.
Novelis said by focusing on just a small slice of steel-aluminum competition and ignoring the broader competitive process, DOJs premise contravened well-established principles of market definition.
With premium valuations at which the deal (Novelis' acquisition of Aleris) has been agreed upon, we believe the retention of the auto body sheet business is essential for the deal to be value-accretive for Hindalco, said the Emkay report.

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has rejected Novelis Inc, the US subsidiary of Hindalco Industries, bid to acquire Aleris Corporation on basis that the deal would eliminate competition in automotive body sheet manufacturing.
However, the company has decided to defend its case in an arbitration process and committed to close the proposed acquisition.
Novelis is confident that the DoJ suit is not an impediment to closing the transaction by January 21, 2020, even if a remedy is required to address the DoJs competitive concerns.
Completion of the transaction remains subject to independent regulatory approvals from the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation and the European Commission.

Broker's call: BPCL (Buy),"CMP: 382.15
Target: 466
Media reports suggests that the government is looking to divest its 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL to IOCL or even private players. BPCL is the second largest oil marketing company (OMC) after IOCL and is one of the best managed PSU with presence across refining (33.2 mtpa or 13 per cent of Indian refining), fuel retailing (14,977 stations or 23 per cent of total outlets), E&P stakes in Mozambique, Brazil, Russia, etc, along with city gas distribution (CGD) stake in 17 geographical areas. Besides, BPCL is one of the promoters of IGL, Petronet, etc. In this note, we look at various scenarios in terms of ownership change and its impact on competition landscape of India.
We believe divestment of BPCL to private sector will help maximize revenue for the government (84,700 crore). Divestment to IOCL will create a behemoth although it is unlikely to alter market dynamics in the near term.

That is a potential option for those with the expertise and patience for putting together such a build. We don't offer liquid-cooling here at Puget anymore, because of the greatly increased risk of shipping damage and the added complexity for things like upgrades later on - but folks who build their own systems could opt to go that way. Given the heat these cards put off, though, you would likely need multiple radiators... at least two, looped between pairs of cards (or on completely separate loops) for that to work.

Vedanta: Vedanta may soon get freedom to market gas from Rajasthan block,"GAIL

Vedanta has pricing freedom but not marketing freedom, according to the current interpretation of the production sharing contract for the Rajasthan block. But ministry officials are increasingly of the view that this interpretation may not be the best and so plan to publish a clarification, which would explicitly give Vedanta both marketing and pricing freedom, according to people familiar with the matter.
Pricing freedom has no meaning without marketing freedom. Its impossible for a seller to extract the best price if faced with just one buyer, the person said. The production sharing contract offers enough scope for reinterpretation and doesnt explicitly bar marketing freedom, he added.
The proposed decision could widen the universe of possible gas buyers for Vedanta, which would then be expected to pick a buyer in an open, transparent auction conducted at arms length.

In fact, this is the first time that Bhartis Arpu came higher than that of Jio.
The surge in the stock came at a time when 60% of the Nifty constituents yielded negative returns in the past six months.
The Bharti Airtel stock has been surging in the past three trading sessions and has emerged as the best performer on Nifty50. The firms consolidated revenues in the June quarter rose 2.6% sequentially, led by a 3.3% increase in Arpu (average revenue per user). The divergence in the performance of Vodafone-Idea and Airtel is what has given confidence to inves-tors, giving the stock a big boost.
The growing appetite for the stock helped Bharti Airtel become the 13th most-valued firm by market capitalisation (m-cap) on Tuesday from its rank of 21 at the beginning of the year. The market valuation of the stock climbed to Rs 1.89 lakh crore after surpassing that of Axis Bank,

The resignations, when seen in conjunction with RBI's September directive to restrict the term of the bank's MD & CEO Rana Kapoor till January 31, 2019, have raised concerns over corporate governance, the rating agency said. The agency also changed the outlook to negative from stable.

Adani fails to keep Sep 1 date with Vizhinjam port,"Tweet on Twitter
Thiruvananthapuram, Sep 1 : Private multi-port operator Gautam Adani failed to keep his September 1 promise of berthing the first ship from the Vizhinjam Port, near here, on Saturday. A tremendous ammount of work still remains.
Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Ltd (AVPPL) had on December 5, 2015 targeted September 1, 2018 to finish the first phase of the Kerala port.
Adani had said it would be operational in 1,000 days, which was Saturday.
The then Oommen Chandy government had inked the 2015 agreement for the international multi-purpose deepwater seaport project at a cost of Rs 7,525 crores. Adani Ports, which was the lone bidder had sought a Rs 1,635 crore grant for this.
Vizhinjam Mother Port Action Committee member Elias John said: “What has happened is the interest shown by the Chandy government is absent with the present government.
“If the things continue to proceed like this, they will be unable to even meet the 1,425 days deadline.”
